This project is intended to help students at University of Cincinnati choose majors, classes and certifications to pursue based on what jobs they are interested in post graduation. While intended for UC students any college students can still use this program to determine what tech jobs might suit them, and what certifications to pursue if they want to maximize their chances of getting the job.
